          <p>Origin of Eukaryotes
          Endogenous origin of nucleus and ER
          It was thought that there was an ancestral cell
          that formed around nucleus, branching led
          ER. This organism was anaerobic. <br><br>

          Serial Endosymbiosis: Theory originally
          proposed by Mereschkovsky (1905) and refined
          by Margulis (1981). <br><br>

          Margulis: Symbiosis driving force in evolution! <br><br>

          Origin of mitochondrion: 2 ideas
          Prokaryote before. Now, bigger cell
          engulfed it for food but didn't digest.

          Because it utilized oxygen, had a more
          efficient ATP production. Good for both
          partners. Gave rise to animal, fungi and
          other heterotrophs. <br><br>

          Origin of chloroplast: Came after mitochondrion.
          Engulfed it, and stayed because it was
          beneficial. <br><br>

          Why would you believe mitochondrion evolved first?

          All cells have mitochondria but not chloroplast. <br><br>

          Primary endosymbiosis led to red alga and green alga lines.

          Followed by secondary endosymbiosis in red and green algal
          lines. Can have occurred more than once? Photosynthetic
          protists are algae. Count chloroplast membranes to see
          how many times endosymbiosis occurred.

          Evidence: Based on similarities of extant prokaryotes with
          mitochondrion and chloroplast.

          Secondary endosymbiosis has more than 2 chloroplast membranes. <br><br>

          Genome of Eukaryotes <br><br>
          Through horizontal gene transfer, nuclear genome should be
          mixture of Bacteria nad Eukaryotes. Its not! Mixture of
          Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryotes.

          Eukaryotes derived from community of cells exchanging DNA. <br><br>

          Biodiversity of Protista <br><br>

          Biodiversity <br><br>

          Variety of life.

          How different groups of organisms are related.

          Phylogeny: tracing evolutionary history of organisms.

          Systematics: classification of organisms according to
          relationships, based on phylogeny.

          Features used to distinguish between groups of
          orgonisms that are homologous:

          Structure and functions <br><br>
          Ultrastructure, i.e. electron microscope <br><br>
          Biochemistry <br><br>
          Molecular evidence. <br><br>

          Five Kingdom Tree <br><br>


          <h3>Hello test</h3>

          Kingdom Protista recognized in Whitaker 5-kingdom system.

          Plantae, Fungi, Animalia, Protista, Monera.

          Monera went to protista, then it branched to plantae fungi and animalia.

          Protist is informal name for kingdom

          Protists earliest evolved eukaryotes, at least 2.1 billion years ago.

          Very diverse. most unicellular but some multicellular forms.

          Cells are most complex among eukaryotes:
          in unicellular species, carries out all function of organisms.

          Multicellular organisms have division of labor! So can do things better

          Sexual and asexual life cycle present and variable.

          Most nutritionally diverse eukaryotes!

          Photoautotrophs

          Heterotrophs

          Mixotrophs: Combines heterotrophic and photosynthetic nutrition.

          Why kingdom is so much more diverse?

          How kingdom defined flawed!

          <q>Protists are eukaryotes that are not plants fungi or animals</q>

          Protista is polyphyletic!

          When Whitaker made the system, leftover organisms in protista.

          What was done?

          All eukaryotes redefined into Supergroups.

          Each super group is a clade. <br><br>

          CLADE:

          Supergroup classification "work in progress"
          Disadvantages include:

          Number of groups variable.

          Dotted lines on tree indication of uncertainty of
          groups within.

          Classification of supergroup not consistent

          Adv.

          Dont have hierarchy to worry about.

          Tree used to show relationships

          <br><br>

          Excavata supergroup

          3 Kingdom Taxa - Diplomonads, Parabasalids, Euglenozoans

          Diplomonads and Parabasalids are
          Anaerobic,
          Mitochondria present, modified.

          Mitosomes and hydrogenosome respectvely. NOt sure what
          mitosomes do. Hydrogenosomes generate atp in anaerobic
          conditions.

          Free living or parasites.

          Ex. Giarda intestinalism, a diplomonad parasite.

          Trichomonas vaginalis, a parabasalid, sexually
          transmitted disease.

          Euglenozoans characteristics:

          Flagellated, crystalline rod inside of flagella.

          Two phyla covered in text:

          Euglenids and Kinetoplastids.

          Euglenid characteristics:

          Photosynthetic, heterotrophic or mixotrohpoic.

          Photosynthetic species' chloroplast with 3 membrane layers,
          indicates secondary endosymbiosis!

          Surrounded by pellicle of protein. Cell wall absent!

          <!-- Next time start with Kinetoplastids  -->
